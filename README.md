> This project is under active development. Breaking changes may occur frequently. Not ready for production use.

## Getting Started

1. Obtain the `components.yaml` for the desired GLK release.
2. Run the install script, pointing it at that file:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gardener/gardener-landscape-kit/HEAD/install.sh)" -- \
     --components-file path/to/components.yaml
   ```

   This downloads the matching `glk` binary to `~/.glk/bin/` and prints next steps.

`gardener-landscape-kit`, short GLK, is a toolkit for generating manifests to facilitate GitOps-based management of Gardener landscapes.

## Scope

This repository provides a set of tools and templates to help you create and manage Gardener landscapes which includes:
- The generation of a GitOps style directory structure
- The generation of base manifests for Gardener and extensions
- The calculation of [Image Vectors](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/3de34e4283ba25895f6012cfaf8b84271942262d/docs/deployment/image_vector.md) from [OCM Component Descriptors](https://ocm.software/docs/getting-started/component-descriptor-example/)
- The support of migration scenarios of checked-in manifests and deployed resources

## Deployment System

All generated manifests are intended to be applied via [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/), a popular GitOps operator for Kubernetes.
Therefore, the toolkit's components produce Kubernetes manifests that Flux automatically applies, based on the corresponding Flux configuration manifests.

## Configuration Overlays

Besides the deployment system, generated manifests must allow configuration overlays for various landscapes.
For this purpose, the toolkit heavily relies on [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/), a tool to customize Kubernetes configurations.
The resulting repository structure can be realized in various ways. However, the recommended approach is to use one repository per landscape (see [Repo per environment](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/repository-structure/#repo-per-environment)).
